The two scripts that are here is google.py and practice.py

For google.py what it does is it takes a search term and clicks on the first link after an explicit wait

For practice.py it goes to a selenium practice websites and navigates a few pages with filling out a form at the end of the script. It also utlizes the time module which is not as effective as an explicit wait.
